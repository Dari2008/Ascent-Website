            <p langPath="imprint.text1">
                The free and publicly accessible content of this website has been created with the greatest possible care. 
                However, the provider of this website assumes no liability for the accuracy and timeliness of the free and publicly 
                accessible journalistic advice and news provided.
                Articles identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not necessarily the opinion of the provider.
                Merely by accessing the free and publicly accessible content, no contractual relationship is established between the user 
                and the provider; in this respect, there is a lack of intent to be legally bound by the provider.

            <h3 langPath="imprint.titles.externalLinks">§ 2 External Links</h3>

                This website contains links to third-party websites (<span class='clamps'>'external links'</span>).  
                These websites are subject to the liability of their respective operators. The provider checked the external content for possible legal violations when the external links were first created. At that time, no legal violations were apparent.  
                The provider has no influence on the current and future design or content of the linked websites. The inclusion of external links does not imply that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as their own.  
                Continuous monitoring of external links by the provider without specific indications of legal violations is unreasonable. However, such external links will be deleted immediately upon gaining knowledge of any legal violations.
