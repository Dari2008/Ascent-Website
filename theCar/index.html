                Stored in the cartridge are 8 grams of CO2 gas. As space in the chamber is limited, the gas inside is
                compressed and the pressure is high. When the cartridge is penetrated, gas releases at the back of the
                container. With Newton&#8217;s third law of motion (actio = reactio) it can be explained that the motion
                of the gas in one direction leads to a motion of the car into the other direction.

                Enzo Ferrari once said, “Aerodynamics are for people who can&#8217;t build engines.”
                Due to the technical regulations implemented by STEM Racing we&#8217;re not allowed to modify the
                accelerating force. Therefore, the quote from Enzo Ferrari doesn&#8217;t apply for STEM Racing and we
                focus on minimizing drag and optimizing components to ensure a fast track time without modifying the
                accelerating force.
                To minimize the drag coefficient, which is a value that puts into number, how streamlined an object is,
                we use various CFD analysis techniques. CFD stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics and one of the
                techniques we use is the combined flow visualisation. It combines the conventional streamline
                visualisation with the vector contour plot. The advantage of this technique is that it brings together
                both concepts to get a better understanding of the air&#8217;s direction of movement and at what speed
                the air moves. With this knowledge we can optimise the shape of the car&#8217;s components to make them
                more streamlined (= lower the drag coefficient). Another technique we use is the drag analysis. With
                this type of CFD analysis you can calculate the drag coefficient. Additionally, there are various other
                important CFD analysis techniques that we will not discuss here.

                Another force stopping the car is the friction between the rotating wheels and the fixed part of the
                axle construction. To minimise the friction between these components, we use ball bearings. Testing
                different ball bearings and axle constructions is a crucial part of real-life testing, because it is
                hardly possible to simulate the axial forces acting on the ball bearings and the wear of different ball
                bearing models and manufacturers.

                As there is a fixed amount of force emitted from the CO2 cartridge, it is important to make the car as
                lightweight as possible while still maintaining the minimum weight of 55 grams. Newton&#8217;s second
                law of motion (F = ma) describes that the less an object weighs, the higher is its acceleration when
                applying a certain force.
                To reach the minimum weight of the cars, we make them hollow on the inside to save weight. As the
                freedom of design is very good, we use SLS printing to produce our chassis. It is easier than milling it
                with polyurethane (special hard foam block) because there are less parameters to consider.

                To continually make sure that the wheels, the halo and other components are stable enough to withstand

                The Finite Element Analysis is a simulation that predicts how structures react to forces like stress,
                heat and vibration. Complex models are divided into smaller elements, forces applying on the car are
                defined and equations, considering the structural integrity of materials, are solved. After solving the
                simulation, it is shown if the material is strong enough to withstand a certain force.
